### Bayesian Modeling

Stan enables sophisticated statistical modeling using Bayesian inference, allowing for more accurate and interpretable results in complex data scenarios.

### Flexible and Scalable

Stan's probabilistic programming language is suitable for a wide range of applications, from simple linear regression to multi-level models and time-series analysis.

### Multi-Language, Cross-Platform Toolkit

Interfaces for Python, Julia, R, and the Unix shell make it easy to use Stan in any programming environment,
on  laptops, clusters, or in the cloud.  A rich ecosystem of tools for validation and visualization support
decision-making and communication.

## Community Resources
* The Stan [forums](https://discourse.mc-stan.org) provide support for all user levels and topics, from installing software, to writing Stan programs, to advanced Bayesian modeling techniques and methodology.

* Stan's [documentation](https://mc-stan.org/docs), [tutorials](learn-stan/tutorials.qmd), and [case studies](learn-stan/case-studies.qmd) help users learn and use Stan effectively in their own projects.
The [Prior Choice Recommendations](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations) wiki page provides guidance on appropriate priors for use with Stan.
