### Instrumental Variables Analysis of Randomized Experiments with One-Sided Noncompliance

In this document, we demonstrate how to implement Bayesian inference for causal effects in randomized experiments with one-sided noncompliance using Stan. Specifically, we aim to replicate the analysis presented in Imbens and Rubin (1997). We present Stan models with and without the exclusion restriction assumption, showcasing a significant advantage of the Bayesian model-based approach.

### Bayesian model of planetary motion: exploring ideas for a modeling workflow when dealing with ordinary differential equations and multimodality

The Bayesian model of planetary motion is a simple but powerful example that illustrates important concepts, as well as gaps, in prescribed modeling workflows. Our focus is on Bayesian inference using Markov chains Monte Carlo for a model based on an ordinary differential equations (ODE). Our example presents unexpected multimodality, causing our inference to be unreliable and what is more, dramatically slowing down our ODE integrators. What do we do when our chains do not mix and do not forget their starting points? Reasoning about the computational statistics at hand and the physics of the modeled phenomenon, we diagnose how the modes arise and how to improve our inference. Our process for fitting the model is iterative, starting with a simplification and building the model back up, and makes extensive use of visualization.

### Bayesian Workflow for disease transmission modeling in Stan


This tutorial shows how to build, fit, and criticize disease transmission models in Stan, and should be useful to researchers interested in modeling the COVID-19 outbreak and doing Bayesian inference.
Bayesian modeling provides a principled way to quantify uncertainty and incorporate prior knowledge into the model.
What is more, Stan's main inference engine, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, is amiable to diagnostics, which means we can verify whether our inference is reliable.
Stan is an expressive probabilistic programing language that abstracts the inference and allows users to focus on the modeling. The resulting code is readable and easily extensible, which makes the modeler's work more transparent and flexible.
In this tutorial, we demonstrate with a simple Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model how to formulate, fit, and diagnose a compartmental model in Stan.
We also introduce more advanced topics which can help practitioners fit sophisticated models; notably, how to use simulations to probe our model and our priors, and computational techniques to scale ODE-based models.

### Model-based Inference for Causal Effects in Completely Randomized Experiments

In this document, we discuss the implementation of Bayesian model-based inference for causal effects in Stan. We start by providing an introduction to the Bayesian inferential framework by analyzing a simulated dataset generated under unconfounded treatment assignment. Then we analyze an example dataset obtained from a completely randomized experiment focusing on the specification of the joint distribution of the potential outcomes.

### Tagging Basketball Events with HMM in Stan

This case study shows how we can apply Bayesian inference to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) using Stan to extract useful information from basketball player tracking data. Specifically we show how to tag drive events and how to determine defensive assignment. Before diving into basketball data we show how to fit an HMM in Stan using a simple example. This should help build some intuition for those who are unfamiliar with HMMs and will also show how to specify an HMM using Stan.

### Model building and expansion for golf putting

In this case study, we use Stan to build a series of models to estimate the probability of a successful putt using data from professional golfers.  We fit and check the fit of a series of models, demonstrating the benefits of modeling based on substantive (rather than purely statistical) principles.  We successfully fit to a small dataset and then have to expand the model to fit a new, larger dataset.  We use weakly informative priors and a model-misfit error term to enable the fit.

### A Dyadic Item Response Theory Model: Stan Case Study

In this case study, we use Stan to fit the Dyadic Item Response Theory (dIRT) model proposed by (Gin et al. 2019) to measure interactions between pairs of individuals when the responses to items represent the actions/behaviors/perceptions of an individual (called the 'actor') made within the context of a dyad formed with another individual (called the 'partner'). The dIRT model is fit using Stan (version 2.18.1) in R via the rstan package.

### Multilevel Linear Models using Rstanarm

In this tutorial, we illustrate how to fit a multilevel linear model within a full Bayesian framework using rstanarm. This tutorial is aimed primarily at educational researchers who have used lme4 in R to fit models to their data and who may be interested in learning how to fit Bayesian multilevel models. However, for readers who have not used lme4 before, we briefly review the use of the package for fitting multilevel models.

### Predator-Prey Population Dynamics: the Lotka-Volterra model in Stan

Lotka (1925) and Volterra (1926) formulated parametric differential
equations that characterize the oscillating populations of predators
and prey. A statistical model to account for measurement error and
unexplained variation uses the deterministic solutions to the
Lotka-Volterra equations as expected population sizes. Stan is used to
encode the statistical model and perform full Bayesian inference to
solve the inverse problem of inferring parameters from noisy data. The
model is fit to Canadian lynx and snowshoe hare populations between
1900 and 1920, based on the number of pelts collected annually by the
Hudson’s Bay Company. Posterior predictive checks for replicated data
show the model fits this data well. Full Bayesian inference may be
used to estimate future (or past) populations.

### Nearest neighbor Gaussian process (NNGP) models in Stan


Nearest neighbor Gaussian process (NNGP) based models is a
family of highly scalable Gaussian processes based models. In brief,
NNGP extends the Vecchia’s approximation (Vecchia 1988) to a process
using conditional independence given information from neighboring
locations. This case study shows how to express and fit these models
in Stan.

### Modelling Loss Curves in Insurance with RStan


Loss curves are a standard actuarial technique for helping
insurance companies assess the amount of reserve capital they need to
keep on hand to cover claims from a line of business. Claims made and
reported for a given accounting period are tracked separately over
time. This enables the use of historical patterns of claim development
to predict expected total claims for newer policies.

We model the growth of the losses in each accounting period as an
increasing function of time, and use the model to estimate the
parameters which determine the shape and form of this growth. We also
use the sampler to estimate the values of the “ultimate loss ratio”,
i.e. the ratio of the total claims on an accounting period to the
total premium received to write those policies. We treat each
accounting period as a cohort.

### Spatial Models in Stan: Intrinsic Auto-Regressive Models for Areal Data


This case study shows how to efficiently encode and compute an
Intrinsic Conditional Auto-Regressive (ICAR) model in Stan.
When data has a neighborhood structure, ICAR models provide spatial smoothing
by averaging measurements of directly adjoining regions.
The Besag, York, and Mollié (BYM) model is a Poisson GLM which
includes both an ICAR component and an ordinary
random-effects component for non-spatial heterogeneity.
We compare two variants of the BYM model and fit two datasets
taken from epidemiological studies over 56 and 700 regions, respectively.

### Typical Sets and the Curse of Dimensionality

 This case study illustrates the so-called “curse of
dimensionality” using simple examples based on simulation to show that
all points are far away in high dimensions and that the mode is an
atypical draw from a multivariate normal.  The information-theoretic
concept of typical set is illustrated with both discrete and
continuous cases, which show that probability mass is a product of
volume and density (or count and mass in the discrete case).  It also
illustrates Monte Carlo methods and relates distance to the log
density of the normal distribution and the chi-squared distribution.

hierarchical models of [Lin, Gelman, Price, and Kurtz (1999)](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/lin.pdf){target="_blank"}.
It illustrates how to generalize linear regressions to hierarchical models with
group-level predictors and how to compare predictive inferences and
evaluate model fits. Along the way it shows how to get data into Stan
using pandas, how to sample using PyStan, and how to visualize the results
using Seaborn.

### The Impact of Reparameterization on Point Estimates

 When changing variables, a Jacobian adjustment needs to be
provided to account for the rate of change of the transform. Applying
the adjustment ensures that inferences that are based on expectations
over the posterior are invariant under reparameterizations. In
contrast, the posterior mode changes as a result of the
reparameterization. In this note, we use Stan to code a repeated
binary trial model parameterized by chance of success, along with its
reparameterization in terms of log odds in order to demonstrate the
effect of the Jacobian adjustment on the Bayesian posterior and the
posterior mode. We contrast the posterior mode to the maximum
likelihood estimate, which, like the Bayesian estimates, is invariant
under reparameterization. Along the way, we derive the logistic
distribution by transforming a uniformly distributed variable.

### Two-Parameter Logistic Item Response Model

This tutorial introduces the R package edstan for estimating
two-parameter logistic item response models using Stan without knowing
the Stan language. Subsequently, the tutorial explains how the model
can be expressed in the Stan language and fit using the rstan
package. Specification of prior distributions and assessment of
convergence are discussed. Using the Stan language directly has the
advantage that it becomes quite easy to extend the model, and this is
demonstrated by adding a latent regression and differential item
functioning to the model. Posterior predictive model checking is also
demonstrated.

### Pooling with Hierarchical Models for Repeated Binary Trials

This note illustrates the effects on posterior inference of
pooling data (aka sharing strength) across items for repeated binary
trial data.  It provides Stan models and R code to fit and check
predictive models for three situations: (a) complete pooling, which
assumes each item is the same, (b) no pooling, which assumes the items
are unrelated, and (c) partial pooling, where the similarity among the
items is estimated.  We consider two hierarchical models to estimate
the partial pooling, one with a beta prior on chance of success and
another with a normal prior on the log odds of success.  The note
explains with working examples how to (i) fit models in RStan and plot
the results in R using ggplot2, (ii) estimate event probabilities,
(iii) evaluate posterior predictive densities to evaluate model
predictions on held-out data, (iv) rank items by chance of success,
(v) perform multiple comparisons in several settings, (vi) replicate
new data for posterior p-values, and (vii) perform graphical posterior
predictive checks.
